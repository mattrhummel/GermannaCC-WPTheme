# GermannaCC WordPress Theme [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/olefredrik/FoundationPress.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/olefredrik/FoundationPress)

This is a WordPress theme for Germanna.edu customized using FoundationPress starter theme which uses Foundation Framework by Zurb. 

## Requirements

GermannaCC Theme uses SASS. SASS is a CSS pre-processor that allows you to write styles more effectively and tidy. To compile the SASS files into one stylesheet you will need to use Grunt task runner.

Grunt and Grunt plugins are installed and managed via npm, the Node.js package manager. Before setting up Grunt ensure that your npm is up-to-date by running ```npm update -g npm``` (this might require ```sudo``` on certain systems)

Bower is a package manager used by Zurb to distribute Foundation. When you have Bower installed, you will be able to run ```foundation update``` in the terminal to update Foundation to the latest version. (After an upgrade you must run ```grunt build``` to recompile files).

**You'll need to have the following items installed before continuing.**

  * [Node.js](http://nodejs.org)
  * [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/): Run `[sudo] npm install -g grunt-cli`
  * [Bower](http://bower.io): Run `[sudo] npm install -g bower`

### Stylesheet Folder Structure

  * `style.css`: Do not worry about this file. (For some reason) it's required by WordPress. All styling are handled in the Sass files described below

  * `scss/foundation.scss`: Imports for Foundation components and your custom styles.
  * `scss/config/_settings.scss`: Original Foundation 5 base settings
  * `scss/config/_custom-settings.scss`: Copy the settings you will modify to this file. Make it your own
  * `scss/site/*.scss`: Unleash your creativity and make it look perfect. Create the files you need (and remember to make import statements for all your files in scss/foundation.scss)
  
  * `css/foundation.css`: All Sass files are minified and compiled to this file
  * `css/foundation.css.map`: CSS source maps

### Script Folder Strucutre
  
  * `bower_components/`: This is the source folder where all Foundation components are located. `foundation update` will check and update scripts in this folder.

  * `js/custom`: This is where you put all your custom scripts. Every .js file you put in this directory will be minified and concatinated to [foundation.js](https://github.com/olefredrik/FoundationPress/blob/master/js/foundation.js)

  * `js/vendor`: Vendor scripts are copied from `bower_components/` to this directory. We use this path for enqueing the vendor scripts in WordPress.

  * Please note that you must run `grunt build` in your terminal for the script to be copied and concatinated. See [Gruntfile.js](https://github.com/olefredrik/FoundationPress/blob/master/Gruntfile.js) for details
